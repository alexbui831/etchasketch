Final Thoughts:
This assignment for the Odin Project was, in my opinion, medium level of difficulty. I knew what kind of methods and functions it took to complete this project but wasn't fully sure how to implement them. I believe that with more experiences with projects like these will allow me to have an easier time to lay the foundations of future projects. I struggled mostly with the beginning code by trying to come up with very efficient solutions/functions for creating new grids and button coloring functionalities using arrow functions and DOM methods. After plenty of googling, I learned to create the foundation of this etchasketch project. 

What I gained from this project:
+Familiarized more with JavaScript methods and arrow functions
+Familiarized more with HTML and DOM elements
+Familiarized more with event listeners such as "mouseover" and "click"
+Familiarized more with CSS grid
+Familizarzed more with CSS styling in general
+Learned how to use a <slider input> to pass a number to newGrid function
